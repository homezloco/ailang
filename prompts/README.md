## Usage

### 1. System Prompts

System prompts define the behavior and capabilities of the AI when working with AILang. They're designed to be used as the initial instruction set for the model.

### 2. Few-shot Examples

These are example prompts and completions that demonstrate how to use AILang for various tasks. They're useful for few-shot learning scenarios.

### 3. Prompt Templates

Reusable templates for common operations like code generation, refactoring, and debugging.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the task and expected output format
2. **Use Examples**: Include input/output pairs when possible
3. **Set Constraints**: Specify any constraints or requirements
4. **Iterate**: Test and refine prompts based on model performance
